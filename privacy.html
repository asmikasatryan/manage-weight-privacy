<h2>2. Where data is stored</h2>
<p>There is no central database and we do not collect or store personal measurement data on our servers by default. All measurement data (height, weight, country) is stored locally on the user's device only.</p>

<h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
<p>We use the provided height, weight, and country locally on the device to calculate BMI and display progress charts. No personal measurement data is transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly enable a backup or sync feature (if such a feature exists and you opt in).</p>

<h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
<p>We do not send personal measurement data to third parties. We may use third-party services (for example, Firebase) only to collect aggregated, non-identifiable analytics such as crash reports or anonymized usage statistics. These analytics do not contain personal measurement data tied to your identity.</p>

<h2>5. Data deletion</h2>
<p>Because measurement data is stored locally on your device by default, you can delete it directly in the app (Settings or History). If you believe we hold any server‑side data about you (for example, anonymized analytics logs), contact us at <a href="mailto:manageweight.info@gmail.com">manageweight.info@gmail.com</a> and we will respond within 30 days. Note: we do not maintain a central user database.</p>
