  <h1>Privacy Policy for Manage Weight</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2026-01-01</p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect minimal personal data required to provide BMI calculation and tracking: height, weight, age, and optional gender. We may also collect non-personal analytics data such as crash reports and usage statistics.</p>

  <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
  <p>We use your data to calculate BMI, display progress charts, and improve app functionality. Analytics data is used to monitor crashes and improve performance.</p>

  <h2>3. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share aggregated, non-identifiable analytics with third-party analytics providers (for example Firebase) to improve the app.</p>

  <h2>4. Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>You can request deletion of your personal data by contacting support at: manage.weight.info@gmail.com. We will delete your data within a reasonable timeframe after verification.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or data requests, contact: manage.weight.info@gmail.com</p>
